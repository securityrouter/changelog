The [securityrouter.org](http://securityrouter.org) project is a network operating system and software distribution based on OpenBSD which is developed and maintained by <a href="http://halon.io">Halon Security</a>. New systems are deployed by [downloading](http://dl2.halon.se/vsr/) a software image. The easiest way to update existing systems is to perform an [automatic update](http://securityrouter.org/wiki/Update) from within the product's administration.

New major versions can contain configuration syntax changes which might render a previously working configuration invalid, and thus affect the operation of the system after an update. We therefore urge all users to perform such updates with caution; **take a snapshot** if running it as a virtual machine, or at least **backup the plain-text configuration** and **monitor the update** on the screen/[console](http://securityrouter.org/wiki/Serial_console), so that you can perform recovery or roll back to an older software version (using our help), if necessary.

There is an [RSS feed](https://github.com/securityrouter/changelog/releases.atom) available.
